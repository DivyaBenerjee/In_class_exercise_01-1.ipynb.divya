        "A parse tree is a tree that features the syntactical structure of a sentence as indicated by a conventional punctuation, for instance by uncovering the connections between words or sub-phrases. Depending on which sort of syntax we use, the subsequent tree will have different features. Constituency and dependency parsing are two strategies that utilization various kinds of punctuations. Since they depend on totally different assumptions, the subsequent trees will be altogether different. Although, in the two cases, the ultimate objective is to separate syntactic data. Dependency parsing tells you concerning the current conditions between the words in a sentence and Constituency parsing tells you regarding the sub-expressions or constituents of a sentence.\n",

        "Constituency Parsing is the most common way of investigating the sentences by separating it into sub-states otherwise called constituents.\n",
        "These sub-phrases have a place with a particular class of syntax like NP (noun phrase) and VP(verb phrase).\n",
        "The constituency parse tree depends on the formalism of context free syntaxes. In this sort of tree, the sentence is isolated into constituents, or at least, sub-states that have a place with a particular class in the punctuation.\n",
        "A body electorate parse tree generally contains the expressions of the sentence as its terminal nodes. Normally, each word has a parent hub containing its grammatical feature tag (noun, adjective, verb, etc… ), although this might be overlooked in other graphical representations.\n",
        "The wide range of various non-terminal hubs address the constituents of the sentence and are typically one of action word express, thing phrase, or prepositional phrase (PP).\n",
        "To summarize, I can say that constituency parsing makes trees containing a syntactical representation of a sentence, as per context free grammar. This portrayal is exceptionally progressive and partitions the sentences into its single phrasal constituents.\n",

        "Dependency parsing is the method involved with breaking down the syntactic design of a sentence in light of the conditions between the words in a sentence. The tree produced by dependency parsing is known as a dependency tree.\n",
        "Rather than constituency parsing, dependency parsing doesn't utilize phrasal constituents or sub-phrases. All things being equal, the punctuation of the sentence is communicated as far as conditions between words\n",
        "In dependency parsing, we attempt to utilize dependency based punctuations to break down and deduce both design and semantic conditions and connections between tokens in a sentence.\n",
        "The essential standard behind a dependency syntax is that in any sentence in the language, all words with the exception of one, have some relationship  on different words in the sentence.\n",
        "The word that has no dependency is known as the foundation of the sentence. The action word is taken as the foundation of the sentence generally speaking. The wide range of various words are directly or indirectly way connected to the root action word utilizing joins , which are the conditions.\n",
