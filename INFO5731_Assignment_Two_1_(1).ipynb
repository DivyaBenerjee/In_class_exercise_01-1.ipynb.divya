        "Since they are based on totally different assumptions, the resulting trees will be very different. Although, in both cases, the end goal is to extract syntactic information.\n",

        "\n",
        "Constituency Parsing is the process of analyzing the sentences by breaking down it into sub-phrases also known as constituents. \n",
        "These sub-phrases belong to a specific category of grammar like NP (noun phrase) and VP(verb phrase).\n",
        "The constituency parse tree is based on the formalism of context-free grammars. In this type of tree, the sentence is divided into constituents, that is, sub-phrases that belong to a specific category in the grammar.\n",
        "A constituency parse tree always contains the words of the sentence as its terminal nodes. Usually, each word has a parent node containing its part-of-speech tag (noun, adjective, verb, etc…), although this may be omitted in other graphical representations.\n",
        "All the other non-terminal nodes represent the constituents of the sentence and are usually one of verb phrase, noun phrase, or prepositional phrase (PP).\n",
        "To sum up, i can say that constituency parsing creates trees containing a syntactical representation of a sentence, according to a context-free grammar. This representation is highly hierarchical and divides the sentences into its single phrasal constituents.\n",

        "Dependency parsing is the process of analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence based on the dependencies between the words in a sentence.The tree generated by dependency parsing is known as a dependency tree.\n",
        "As opposed to constituency parsing, dependency parsing doesn’t make use of phrasal constituents or sub-phrases. Instead, the syntax of the sentence is expressed in terms of dependencies between words\n",
        "In dependency parsing, we try to use dependency-based grammars to analyze and infer both structure and semantic dependencies and relationships between tokens in a sentence. \n",
        "The basic principle behind a dependency grammar is that in any sentence in the language, all words except one, have some relationship or dependency on other words in the sentence. \n",
        "The word that has no dependency is called the root of the sentence. The verb is taken as the root of the sentence in most cases. All the other words are directly or indirectly linked to the root verb using links , which are the dependencies\n",
